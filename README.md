# SEO-Checklist
Project to create a SEO Checklist for future reference and test its usage on a dummy website by "Chillomania"</br>
To be found under: [SEO-Checklist](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1LQ_XC7bE8U8AbBv603RYW5ILvAOM99xTbU-MMm2zKcg/edit?usp=sharing)


The Checklist ist split into 4 Topics:
* **Basic/Foundation** - Giving some MarTech to install if you are just starting out wiht optimizing your website
* **Technical SEO** - All the important things to do on a technical level f.e. to increase Page load speed
* **Content SEO** - Improving your content for optimal search engine listing
* **Off-Page SEO** - All the things you can do to optimize your website that is not happening on the page itself f.e. backlinks


Beyond that all items in the list have a priority level (high, medium, low) to bring attention to the most important pieces to be done. Can also be adjusted to individual cases. An example, where the checklist got used, with adapted prioritazion, can be found in the second Tab named "Chillomania". It is the analysis of a dummy-website for the fictiour Company "Chillomania" selling couches.
